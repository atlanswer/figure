# Figure

**Create publication quality figures. Work in progress!**

Part of the [AntCal](https://github.com/atlanswer/AntCal) project.

If you encountered any issue, please reach out to me.

This web app is built with the following tools:

- [Solid](https://solidjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

And it's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Notes

$$
e = mc^2

### Figures

- Currently all sources are positioned at the origin
- Amplitudes are normalized to the maximum radiation of E-/M-dipole respectively
- Far fields are sampled every 1°
- There may be bugs in phase implementation

#### E-dipole:

- Gain $θ$: $\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi)$
- Gain $ϕ$: $\sin(\phi)$

#### M-dipole:

- Gain $θ$: $\sin(\phi)$
- Gain $ϕ$: $\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi)$

#### Linear Combination with Arbitrary Phase Shift [^wikipedia]

We have

$$
a\sin(x+\theta_a)+b\sin(x+\theta_b)=c\sin(x+\varphi)
$$

where $c$ and $\varphi$ satisfy

$$
\begin{gather*}
c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+2ab\cos(\theta_a-\theta_b)}\text{,} \\
\varphi=\operatorname{atan2}(a\cos\theta_a+b\cos\theta_b,\ a\sin\theta_a+b\sin\theta_b)\text{.}
\end{gather*}
$$

Note: $\operatorname{atan2(y,\ x)}$ uses Numpy's [`arctan2`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arctan2.html) parameter order.
